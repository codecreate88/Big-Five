Big Five Personality Test

This project attempts to classify individuals into 5 cluster personalities.  Based on the Big Five Personality Traits, these clusters are : Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness.

Two machine learning algorithms were used in this project:
1. Unsupervised KMeans Clustering 
2. Perceptron 

After fitting both models, 4 fictitious characters were created and the models were employed to predict which cluster their personalities fell under.
